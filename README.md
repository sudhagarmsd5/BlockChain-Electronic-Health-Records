Summary : The "Secure Electronic Health Records" project utilizes Ethereum blockchain, Metamask, and Ganache to enable patients to securely upload medical data and also view his data, manage doctor access, and view data history. Doctors can manage patient lists, access records, generate consultancy reports, and revoke access given by patient. Diagnostic centers can create EHR reports, ensuring visibility for both patients and doctors through IPFS integration. This decentralized approach enhances data security, interoperability, and patient control over health information, ultimately improving healthcare delivery and patient outcomes.
